==========================================

Input/Ouput (I/O):
==================
	- Input: writing content to the memory (input for memory)
	- Output: reading content from the memory (output from memory / literal)

	- Console I/O: 
		- Input (write): We take input from console input device (by default: keyboard) & store in 
			  memory (variable/instance)
	 	- Output (read): We read content from memory (variable/instance) & send output to 
			  console output device (by default screen)

	- File I/O: 
		- We take input from a file (no default, we have to specify the source file)
			& store in memory (variable/instance)
	 	- We read content from memory (variable/instance) & send output to 
			a file (no default, we have to specify the destination file)

	## For ANY KIND of Input, we need to use one of the suitable INPUT-STREAM CLASS INSTANCE 
		as a bridge between the source of input and memory

	## For ANY KIND of Output, we need to use one of the suitable OUTPUT-STREAM CLASS INSTANCE 
		as a bridge between the destination of output and memory

I/O in C++:
===========
	Type of I/O		Stream class name	Purpose
	--------------		------------------	--------------------------
	Console input		istream			writing to memory, from KB
	Console output		ostream			reading from memory, to screen

	File input		ifstream		writing to memory, from a specified file
	File output		ofstream		reading from memory, to a specified file
	File Input & Output	fstream			reading and writing- using same stream from/to a file


Console I/O in Java:
====================
	Type of I/O		Stream class name	Purpose
	--------------		------------------	--------------------------
	Console input		InputStream(System.in)	writing to memory, from KB
	Console output		PrintStream(System.out)	reading from memory, to screen

	- instead of using read methods of InputStream class, [ System.in.read(); ] we use Scanner instance
	  and provide InputStream instance (System.in) to the constructor of Scanner as the source of scanning
 	  for convenience.

File Handling in Java (File I/O):
=================================

	- Text file: 
		- Stores character, so that any text editor can open & read the content as characters
			Ex: If your ID is 1830289, in text file it will be stored as
				"1830289", content size will be 7 bytes for 7 characters
	- Binary file:
		- Stores raw data
			Ex: If your ID is 1830289, in binary file actual bytes of the value will stored.
				therefore, content size will be 4 bytes as the input is an integer

Difference between text & binary file:
--------------------------------------
 - Storage device stores: binary equivalent (irrespective of file type)
	- SSD/FlashDrive/RAM: presence/absence of electric charges
	- Magnetic drive: megnetized/demagnetized cell
	- optical drive: high/low intensity laser pits

 - Text file:
	- Every bytes of a text file is considered as the ascii code of a character
	- When we open a text file using a text editor (notepad, subline, word,...)
		it shows corresponding character for the bytes stored in that file
	- Therefore, we use text file to store textual data

 - Binary file:
	- Store raw data:
		- image file (collection of pixel bytes)
		- Audio file	
		- video file
		- writing/reading instances to/from file
		- database

Q: What type of file you will use for your project
A: 
	- Mostly we will use binary files (for application data)
	- A few text files (readme/help/FAQ/installationGuide, etc)


Why we will use binary file for our project:
============================================

Suppose we have an int x = 123
binary of 123 (4 bytes) is:  00000000 00000000 00000000 01111011
these 4 bytes need to be converted to bytes (ascii code) of character '1', '2' & '3'
	
binary of "123": 		00110001 00110010 00110011
				ascii:49   50	    51

 - While writing: Integer.toString(..);	//additional task
	Conversion: 00000000 00000000 00000000 01111011 --> 00110001 00110010 00110011

 - While reading : Integer.parseInt(..);	//additional task
	Conversion: 00110001 00110010 00110011 --> 00000000 00000000 00000000 01111011

 - Also, keeping application data in text file will allow anyone to view the content using
	any text editor. But the content of a binary file can't be retrieved unless the 
	user knows the metadata.

 - We can also have some text file in our project such as "readme.txt", "faq.txt", "about.txt"


Streams that we can use to perform file I/O in java:
===========================================-========

- Byte stream					[Both for text & binary file]
	- read/write raw bytes from/to file
	Classes:
		Reading: FileInputStream
		Writing: FileOutputStream

- Character stream				[For text file, recommended]
	- read/write characters from/to file
	Classes:
		Reading: FileReader or Scanner for convenience (File will be source of Scanner)
		Writing: FileWriter

- Data stream					[For binary file]
	- read/write different data types as it is (their actual bytes) from/to file
	Classes:
		Reading: DataInputStream
		Writing: DataOutputStream

	As an intermediate layer to increase read/write efficiency, we can use Buffer in between
	Data & Byte streams
		Classes: BufferedInputStream & BufferedOutputStream

- Object stream					[For binary file]
	- read/write deserialized/serialized instances from/to file
	Classes:
		Reading: ObjectInputStream
		Writing: ObjectOutputStream

Text File:
	- We can use Byte stream (if it is 1-byte ASCII character) as well as Character stream
	- However, character stream is recommended for text file

Binary file:
	- Data & Object stream will be used for your project. However, these Data & Object stream
		will internally use Byte stream
	- To generate pdf/jpg --> Byte stream
	- int/float/String & mix of them --> Data stream
	- Only class instances --> Object stream

NOTE: To perform file IO, we need to deploy Exception Handling mechanism

===============================================================================================
tO BE CONTINUED IN NEXT CLASS...

Exception Handling:
===================
	int main(){
		int a,b,c;	cin>>a>>b;
		c = a/b;			//division by zero
		cout<<a<<b<<c;
		return 0;
	}

	//we can avoid this / by 0 situation by optimizing our source code, 
	//Without deploying Exception hndling mechanism.
	int main(){
		int a,b,c;	cin>>a;
		do{
			cin>>b;
		}while(b==0);
		c = a/b;	//critical statement
		cout<<a<<b<<c;
		return 0;
	}

- So far, the programs that we have written had some critical statements, and by analyzing
   the source code, compiler knows potential exception from those critical statements
   can be avoided by optimizing the source code	[UNCHECKED Exception].

- Therefore, compiler never forced us to deploy EH-mechanism for potential UNCHECKED exceptions. 

- BUT, there can be some critical statements which might fail during runtime due to some
   external factors, which is beyond the control of the programmer, and therefore it
   may not be possible to avoid that situation by optimizing our source code. [CHECKED Exception]

- For these critical statements having potential for CHECKED exception, 
	compiler forces us to deploy EH-mechanism:
		- using try-catch-finally block

- File I/O related exceptions are CHECKED exception, 

- File handling is one such case, where exception handling is enforced.


What is Exception????
---------------------
	In C++: It can be any data type
	In Java: It is an instance of ONE-OF-THE Exception class family (inheritance)

int cppArr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	cout<<cppArr[2];	//3
	cout<<cppArr[5];	//garbage

int[] javaArr = {11,22,33,44,55};
	sout(cppArr[2]);	//33
	sout(cppArr[5]);	//wll throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, if not handled, 
				//program will crash


public class SomeClass{
	public void someMethod(){
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		a = s.nextInt(); b = s.nextInt();
		
		c = a/b;	
		// if b is zero, and code is not optimized, so, / by 0 will occur
		//at this point an ArithmeticException instance will be thrown implicitly by the JVM
		//and since there is no catch block, the program will crash immediately

		sout(...);	//this line and lines below will never be executed..
		......		
	}
}



public class SomeClass{
	public void someMethod(){
	    try{
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		a = s.nextInt(); b = s.nextInt();
		
		c = a/b;
		// if b is zero, and code is not optimized, so, / by 0 will occur
		//at this point an ArithmeticException instance will be thrown implicitly
		//and since there is no catch block, the program will crash immediately

		sout(...);	//this and lines below will never be executed..
		......	
 	    }
	    catch(ArithmeticException e){ 
		//exception handling code	
		//e.someMethodOfArithmeticException();
		//e.someGetter(); //to get exception related info to show to the user
		//your own handling code...
	    }
	    catch(RuntimeException e){ 
		//your own handling code...
	    }
	}
}

- You can also have your own exception:
	public class MyException extends AnyOfTheExceptionClassFromExceptionHierarchy {

	}

Five keywords that we need to understand for exception handling:
----------------------------------------------------------------
try:
----
	- represents the block where the critical statements are kept
		(we try to execute critical ststemets here)
	- can have nested try blocks
	- while trying to execute the code inside try block, if an exceptional context arise
		a suitable Exception type instance is thrown by the JVM. Therefore, 
		there must be atleast one (or more) corresponding handling block (catch) 
		associated with the try block.
	- the thrown instance contains runtime contextual data of the exceptional situation
		as fields, which can be used in catck block for amicable solution
	- Once an exception is thrown at a critical ststement, control will leave the try block
		and as a result, rest of the statements of the try block will NEVER be ececuted

catch:
------
	- exception handling block (handling code are kept here)
	- When multiple catch blocks are associated with a try block, we keep the:
		MOST specific catch block (subclass) at the top, and  
		MOST generic (superclass) catch block at the bottom.

finally:
--------

throws:
-------

throw:
------

=====================================================================
Inappropriate order of the catch blocks:

try{
	//citical statements
}
catch(Exception e1){...; e1.someMethod();....;}
catch(RuntimeException e2){...; e2.someMethod();....;}
catchArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e3){...; e3.someMethod();....;}
catch(ArithmeticException e4){...; e4.someMethod();....;}
catch(IOException e5){...; e5.someMethod();....;}
catch(EOFException e6){...; e6.someMethod();....;}

------------------------------------------------------
Right order of the catch blocka:

try{
	//citical statements
}
catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e3){...; e3.someMethod();....;}
catch(ArithmeticException e4){...; e4.someMethod();....;}
catch(RuntimeException e2){...; e2.someMethod();....;}
catch(EOFException e6){...; e6.someMethod();....;}
catch(IOException e5){...; e5.someMethod();....;}
catch(Exception e1){...; e1.someMethod();....;}
